# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
The first 9 lines are creating global variables for the ball and then assigning different qualities for the ball size, shape and position. Then you have the canvas setup
and the function to draw the ball. It is also creating the variables inside the function. By having the x and y coordinates be plus and equal to the global qualites that were already defined (delta and scale) it makes it move automatically and at quickly. The first if statement is to bounce off the width of the screen since if the ball is greater than or equal to width OR less than or equal to 0 then it should be a -1 this keeps each ellipse next to eachother as to create the illusion that it's one shape.
The second if statement is to bounce off the width of the screen since if the ball is greater than or equal to height OR less than or equal to 0 then it should be a -1
once again keeping ellipse next to eachother as to create the illusion that it's one shape. The function at the bottom is to make it so when the mouse is pressed the ball will map to where it's pressed. This makes the ball change direction.

## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--
I changed the sketch by creating if statements to change the color depending on where the ball is hitting. I also increased the ball size and removed the stroke.
