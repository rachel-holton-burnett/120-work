I am so excited that i got my stars on this project to not go so fast!! I feel like this has been my biggest accomplishment in this class thus far. I had little bit of trouble with getting my function to call more than once. I figured out that it's because I needed the translate and scale in order for it to be placed on my canvas more than once. I almost had to go to post to the repo tracker but honestly a re-read of the lecture made me realize my mistake. I am really excited to learn about making our own functions. This was a small project but I got almost burned out the first time trying to place all of the stars in the correct place.
