Rachel Holton, 51 [hw-11 readme](https://github.com/rachel-holton-burnett/120-work/tree/master/hw-11) [Animated Drawing](https://rachel-holton-burnett.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

This week was a huge struggle. I understood the concept of the constructor but executing it was another story. After forgetting a bracket on my draw function I had to leave it and come back to it. Finally after literally going over it line by line I figured it out. I am so happy with how it turned out! It reminds me of fireworks of rings! I originally had an ellipse filled with the background color inside the bigger light blue ellipse then I remembered I could do stroke weight instead. It looks better because it's even and it's easier. I hope it's okay that I did over the 40 times of the requested assignment. I liked the way it looked with 150 instead. I did post my problem to the issue board and one person did respond but didn't find my minor (yet code ending) error.
