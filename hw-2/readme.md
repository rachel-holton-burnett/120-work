## Homework Assignment Week 2

1. This week was particularly difficult as I haven't done any coding since high school which was over 10 years ago. Not only what we are doing is vastly different, I obviously don't remember everything about it. Using the command prompt was a huge learning curve for me and I am looking forward to practicing more so I can get the hang of it.

2. There weren't many steps with this assignment and I was able to download all of the programs necessary without trouble except for Atom.

3. When I initially downloaded Atom I was able to set it up without any problems, however when I went to open it up the following day it appeared to be gone from my computer. So I redownloaded it and all of my settings were saved from the previous time. The day after this when I went to open Atom it wouldn't load. I restarted my computer and to no avail; it still would not load. So I uninstalled it and redownloaded it. Once again when it was redownloaded all of my settings were there. I did report this to the issue tracker. I did post this to the issues thread and got some very insightful help from fellow classmates.

4. There isn't anything in particular that I want to discuss further for this week.

5. I did not see any issues from my fellow classmates that I would be able to help with.

I wasn't sure how to add the rest of the criteria within my report so here is some useless information that I made so I can practice using markup. 

These are my most frequented websites:
- [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com)
- [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com)
- [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and of course
- [University of Montana](http://my.umt.edu)

##Here is a list of my favorite dog breeds
1. American Pit Bull Terrier
  - Or you could call it just a Pit Bull. Or a Pittie.
2. Bull Terriers
  -The target dog
3. French Bulldogs
  -Sometimes called Frenchies
#It is my dream some day to have all of these types of dogs but for now I only have a Pit Bull.```
