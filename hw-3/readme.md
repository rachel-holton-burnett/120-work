["Hello World!" Sketch](https://rachel-holton-burnett.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

This week I was excited to code a little bit and take the first step into creating a design with code. I picked teal as my background color because it's one of my favorite colors and the black text popped perfectly. This kept it easy to read and simple. I wanted the Hello World! to be somewhat centered in the square and I wanted it to use up the space. So I enlarged the size of the text and chose coordinates where it would be in the center. Reading p5 reference was really helpful to understand what each piece of code did and to play with the text a little bit beyond what the assignment called for. The only issues I had this week were once again with Atom. The repo issue tracker was super helpful once again as I'm not the only one who has had these problems. Dragging the icon of my file to Atom opened it up perfectly. I did have to somewhat job my memory on how to push the changes to my repo but I figured it out pretty quickly and did not have to re-read the previous lesson. I was excited to learn about the comments and I forsee those coming in helpful for me in the future. I like to make myself lots of notes as I am working on projects to remember where I'm at or what I've tried. I have been keeping my eye on the repo issue tracker and did not see any issues that I could assist with this week.
