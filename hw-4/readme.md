Rachel Holton, 51 [hw-4 readme](https://github.com/rachel-holton-burnett/120-work/tree/master/hw-4) [Monster Sketch](https://rachel-holton-burnett.github.io/120-work/hw-4/)

This week was extremely difficult for me. I had a really hard time with translate and the x,y coordinates. I chose to draw a monster because I thought it would be fun to add some of the accents that I did like the horns on his head. The p5.js reference page was very helpful for me this week but I don't feel like I have a 100% grasp on the coordinates of the shapes. I understand x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3 etc. but which coordinate is x1 for each shape? I would like a diagram that lays that out. I did not use the help page at all this week but I did respond to someone and I hope I was helpful. I am looking forward to the following weeks so I can practice this more as I had a lot of hurdles to get over this week.
