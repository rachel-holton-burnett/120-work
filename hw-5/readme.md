Rachel Holton, 51 [hw-5 readme](https://github.com/rachel-holton-burnett/120-work/tree/master/hw-5) [Animated Drawing](https://rachel-holton-burnett.github.io/120-work/hw-5/)

This week was a little easier this week. I am starting to grasp the coordinates better and try to really be thinking about things on a graph. However, often times I still do a lot of trial and error to determine where my shape needs to go. I tried to create "stars" (ellipses) in the background but had a difficult time with them going way too fast. When I slowed down the frame rate it made my rocket lag horribly. So I had no choice but to up it and just have the stars in the background go really quickly. I'm not sure what else I could adjust to have these slow down, as I played with the x and y positions and didn't get much of a change. I'm looking forward to learning more about animation next week so I might be able to better understand it. For this assignment I first created my stars, then I worked on the rocket then I created the moon as I knew the moon would be stationary. The only issue that I posted I figured out myself after posting it. I found the example in the lesson extremely helpful.
