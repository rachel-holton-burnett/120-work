Rachel Holton, 51 [hw-6 readme](https://github.com/rachel-holton-burnett/120-work/tree/master/hw-5) [Algorithmic Sketch](https://rachel-holton-burnett.github.io/120-work/hw-6/)

This week was extremely difficult and I had trouble getting everything to work. I could not figure out the random function for quite some time. I didn't use any of the math functions because I felt like I didn't know where I could use them in my sketch. The only one that I felt could be applicable was constrain and I had so much trouble with it that I scrapped it. I discovered I needed to pay close attention to the sizes of the circles to make sure it goes biggest to smallest otherwise I will have some that will end up being covered up. I did post any problems to the issue tracker because I didn't even know where to start I felt really lost.
