I had a really difficult time this week trying to get everything to work the way I wanted. Multiple codes that I tried did not work and I'm still not sure what was missing in them. I originally wanted the circles to come up from the bottom and wasn't able to acheive that. I ended up just playing with the x/y coordinates which gave some variety. I'm disapointed with how this week turned out but I kind of hit a creative and technical wall this week.
